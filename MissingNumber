Problem Statement : Find Missing Numbers in a Range

Tables : 
CREATE TABLE Numbers (
    id INT,
    num INT
);

INSERT INTO Numbers (id, num) VALUES
(1, 1),
(2, 2),
(3, 4),
(4, 6),
(5, 7),
(6, 10);



Solution : 
 with recursive cte as (select min(num) as n from Numbers union all select n+1 from cte where n < (select max(num) as n from Numbers)) select ct.n as missing_number from cte ct left join Numbers n1 on ct.n=n1.num where n1.id is null;
