Problem Statement : A table named “famous” has two columns called user id and follower id. It represents each user ID has a particular follower ID. These follower IDs are also users of hashtag#Facebook / hashtag#Meta. Then, find the famous percentage of each user. 
Famous Percentage = number of followers a user has / total number of users on the platform.

Tables :

CREATE TABLE famous (user_id INT, follower_id INT);

INSERT INTO famous VALUES
(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3), 
(11, 7), (12, 8), (13, 5), (13, 10), 
(14, 12), (14, 3), (15, 14), (15, 13);


Solution : 

WITH all_users AS (
    SELECT user_id 
    FROM famous
    UNION 
    SELECT follower_id 
    FROM famous
),
total_followers AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_followers
    FROM famous
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT 
    user_id,
    (total_followers * 100.0) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_users) AS famous_percentage
FROM total_followers;
